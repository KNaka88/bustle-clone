However, Target's 2017 swimsuit campaign is shaking things up in the most beautiful way. The ads feature four models with different body types &mdash; and the images haven't been Photoshopped. Instead, the Target 2017 swimwear ads are real AF, (and that makes them beautiful AF, too)! The gorgeous models pose in a variety of suits. There are stretch marks and curves, which are basically all the authentic things you will see at the beach, by the pool, and in life as you know it. According to Cosmo, Target released a statement about its decision to publish the images without any retouching. The statement read as follows: &quot;Target is committed to empowering women to feel confident in what they wear by offering a variety of style choices. We loved working with these women because they embody confidence and inspire [others] to embrace and be proud of who they are, regardless of their size or shape.&quot; Target also declared, &quot;It was important to us to use photography that represented their true beauty, without filters.&quot; That's how it should be all the time!",
